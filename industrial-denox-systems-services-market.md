<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial DeNOx Systems & Services Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SCR</li><li>SNCR</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial DeNOx systems and services include two main technologies: Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) and Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR). SCR involves injecting a reagent, typically ammonia, into exhaust gases in the presence of a catalyst to convert nitrogen oxides (NOx) into harmless nitrogen and water. SNCR operates at higher temperatures, where reagents are injected directly into the flue gas, facilitating NOx reduction without a catalyst. Both technologies aim to minimize NOx emissions, thereby aiding compliance with environmental regulations and enhancing air quality.</p></p>
