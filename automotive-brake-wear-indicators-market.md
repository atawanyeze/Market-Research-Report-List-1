<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Brake Wear Indicators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electrical Indicators</li><li>Audible Indicators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive brake wear indicators are crucial safety features that alert drivers when brake components require replacement. Electrical indicators use sensors to monitor brake pad thickness and activate warning lights on the dashboard when wear exceeds a certain threshold. Audible indicators, on the other hand, produce a sound—often a squeal or grinding noise—when brake pads are worn down, signaling the need for service. Both types enhance safety by ensuring timely maintenance and preventing brake failure on the road.</p></p>
