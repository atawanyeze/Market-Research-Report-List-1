<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Fin Stabilizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Retractable</li><li>Non-Retractable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electric fin stabilizer market is divided into two main types: retractable and non-retractable stabilizers. Retractable stabilizers can be deployed and retracted as needed, making them ideal for vessels that require flexibility and streamlined designs when not in use. In contrast, non-retractable stabilizers are permanently fixed, providing continuous stabilization benefits without the need for deployment. Both types enhance vessel stability, improving safety and comfort during navigation, but their choice depends on specific vessel requirements and operational conditions.</p></p>
