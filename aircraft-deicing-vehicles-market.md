<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Deicing Vehicles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-propelled</li><li>Towed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aircraft deicing vehicles market consists of two primary types: self-propelled and towed vehicles. Self-propelled deicing vehicles operate independently, equipped with their own power source for maneuverability, allowing for efficient and quick deicing operations directly at the aircraft. Towed deicing vehicles, on the other hand, rely on a towing vehicle for movement, often offering a cost-effective solution for airports with lower deicing demands. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring safe flight operations during winter weather conditions.</p></p>
